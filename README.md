**Potato Disease Detection: PlantVillage Insights 🥔**
=====================================================

**Author:** Phuong Phan
**Date:** 14 July 2024
**Dataset:** Potato Plant Diseases

**Welcome! 🌱**
---------------

We're excited to share our project on potato disease detection using machine learning and computer vision. This project aims to revolutionize the field of precision agriculture by providing a accurate and efficient way to detect potato diseases.

**The Problem 🌪️**
------------------

Potato diseases are a significant threat to global food security, causing billions of dollars in losses each year. However, accurate detection of these diseases remains a challenge. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect potato diseases using image data, enabling farmers and researchers to take targeted action to prevent the spread of disease.

**Methodology 🔍**
-----------------

Our approach involves the following steps:

1. **Data Augmentation 🔄**: We apply random transformations to the images to artificially increase the size of the training set.
2. **Evaluation 📊**: We performance test the accuracy and loss of four pre-trained models: RESNET, Inception, Xception & NASnetMobile on the test dataset.
3. **Fine-tuning 🔩**: We fine-tune the models by unfreezing the weights and training it on the augmented training data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning 🔧**: We define a new model architecture with a custom classification head on top of a pre-trained base model, and compile it with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

**Installing Required Libraries 📚**
-----------------------------------

To get started, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
!pip install kaggle -q
!kaggle datasets download -d hafiznouman786/potato-plant-diseases-data
! unzip potato-plant-diseases-data.zip
```

**Dataset Content 📁**
---------------------

Our dataset contains 2152 images categorized into three classes: early blight, late blight, and healthy.

**Model Architectures 🤖**
-------------------------

We use four pre-trained models:

1. **Xception 🤩**: A deep learning model that uses a novel architecture to achieve state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks.
2. **ResNet50 📈**: A popular deep learning model that uses residual connections to ease the training process.
3. **Inception 🤔**: A deep learning model that uses multiple parallel branches to capture features at different scales.
4. **NASNetMobile 📱**: A deep learning model that uses neural architecture search to find the optimal architecture for mobile devices.

**Model Comparison 📊**
----------------------

We compare the performance of the four models on the test dataset.

**Results 📈**
--------------

Our results show that the Xception model performs best on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy of 97.36%.

**Predicting 🔮**
----------------

We use the Xception model to predict the class of new images.

**GIF 🎥**
----------

We create a GIF to visualize the predictions.

**Conclusion 🌟**

**Welcome! 🌟**

We're excited to share our project on potato disease detection using machine learning. This project is inspired by the innovative approaches of PlantVillage Insights, and we hope to contribute to the development of precision agriculture.

**The Problem 🤔**

Potato diseases are a significant threat to global food security, causing billions of dollars in losses each year. Accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for developing effective management strategies and ensuring a stable food supply. However, disease detection remains a challenging task, especially in resource-constrained environments.

**Our Solution 💡**

We've developed a machine learning model that can detect potato diseases from images. Our model uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to achieve high accuracy. We've also implemented data augmentation techniques to increase the size of our training dataset.

**Dataset 📊**

Our dataset consists of 2152 images of potato plants, each labeled with one of three classes: early blight, late blight, or healthy. We've used this dataset to train and evaluate our model.

**Methodology 🔍**

1. **Data Augmentation**: We've applied random transformations to our images to artificially increase the size of our training dataset.
2. **Model Selection**: We've evaluated the performance of four different models: Xception, ResNet50, Inception, and NASNetMobile.
