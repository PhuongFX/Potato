**Dataset:** Potato Plant Diseases

**Overview üå±**
---------------

We're excited to share our project on potato disease detection using machine learning
This project uses deep learning techniques to detect potato diseases from images. 
This project is inspired by the innovative approaches of PlantVillage Insights, and we hope to contribute to the development of precision agriculture.
The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify diseases such as early blight, late blight, and healthy plants.

* **Dataset**: 2152 images of potato plants, each labeled with one of three classes: early blight, late blight, or healthy.
* **Model**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning and data augmentation.
* **Accuracy**: 97.3% on our test dataset.

**Motivation üå™Ô∏è**
-----------------

Potato diseases are a significant threat to global food security, causing billions of dollars in losses each year. Traditional methods of disease detection are time-consuming and require expertise. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect potato diseases quickly and accurately, enabling farmers and researchers to take targeted action to prevent the spread of disease.

**Inspiration**
---------------

The devastating impact of potato diseases on global food security, with losses estimated to be in the billions, has long been a pressing concern for agricultural researchers and farmers alike. However, accurate detection of these diseases remains a significant challenge, hindering our ability to develop effective management strategies and ensure a stable food supply. This project embarks on a journey to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting potato diseases using image data, leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning to revolutionize the field of precision agriculture, as inspired by the innovative approaches of PlantVillage Insights.

**Problem Statement**
-------------------

The potato disease dataset is a comprehensive collection of images meticulously categorized into three distinct classes: early blight, late blight, and healthy. Each class represents a specific condition affecting potato crops, enabling researchers and agricultural experts to delve into the intricacies of disease identification, progression, and management.

** Solution üí°**

A machine learning model that can detect potato diseases from images. Using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to achieve high accuracy.


**Methodology üîç**

1. **Data Augmentation**: We've applied random transformations to our images to artificially increase the size of our training dataset.
2. **Model Selection**: We've evaluated the performance of four different models: Xception, ResNet50, Inception, and NASNetMobile.
3. **Fine-tuning**: We've fine-tuned our models using learning rate reduction and early stopping callbacks to prevent overfitting.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We've optimized our model's hyperparameters using a grid search approach.

**Methodology**
--------------

1. **Data Augmentation**: Apply random transformations to the images to artificially increase the size of the training set using TF-keras pre-processing layers.
2. **Evaluation**: Performance test accuracy and loss of 4 Models: RESNET, Inception, Xception & NASnetMobile on the test dataset. Visualizing curves over epochs using matplotlib to identify potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
3. **Fine-tuning**: 4 Models model is specifically fine-tuned further by unfreezing the weights and training it on the augmented training data. With learning rate reduction and early stopping callbacks to prevent overfitting, and its test accuracy is evaluated.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The code defines a new model architecture with a custom classification head on top of a pre-trained base model, and compiles it with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
5. **Prediction**: Made on a random sample of images from the validation set. Incorrect predictions are also identified and visualized.

**Methodology üîç**
-----------------

Our approach involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing üîÑ**: We apply random transformations to the images to artificially increase the size of the training set.
2. **Model Selection ü§î**: We compare the performance of four pre-trained models: RESNET, Inception, Xception & NASnetMobile on the test dataset.
3. **Fine-tuning üî©**: We fine-tune the models by unfreezing the weights and training it on the augmented training data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning üîß**: We define a new model architecture with a custom classification head on top of a pre-trained base model, and compile it with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.


**Model Comparison üìä**
-------------------

| Model | Valid Dataset Accuracy | Test Dataset Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Xception | 0.9736 | 0.97 |
| ResNet50 | 0.9950 | 0.99 |
| Inception | 0.9577 | 0.95 |
| NASNetMobile | 0.8999 | 0.92 |

**Predicting**
--------------

We've implemented a prediction function that takes an image as input and returns the predicted class label and confidence score.
```python
def predict(model, img):
    img_array = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(images[i].numpy())
    img_array = tf.expand_dims(img_array, 0)

    predictions = model.predict(img_array)

    predicted_class = class_names[np.argmax(predictions[0])]
    confidence = round(100 * (np.max(predictions[0])), 2)
    return predicted_class, confidence
```
